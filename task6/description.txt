/* Overriding "parent" methods */

Write a function/Class rectangle, which has a method area.
Design yourself how rectangle sides must be set. It can be via function
parameters:

let r = new Rectangle(5, 6);

Or via later assignment:

let r = new Rectangle();
r.a = 5;
r.b = 6;

Write a function/Class square, which will extend the function/class rectangle,
and will also have the area function, but with its own definition.

EXAMPLE.
let r = new Rectangle(5, 6);
r.area()    // Will call Rectangle.prototype.area function

let s = new Square(5);
s.area()    // Will call Square.prototype.area function

s.__proto__.__proto__ === Rectangle.prototype   // true
