REMEMBER 1: Javascript is on of the strongest object oriented programming languages that implements
OOP without classes. Where else you can create an object simply adding { and } (aka let obj = {}).
In other OOP languages like C++ and Java, for an object creation you must implement a class or struct.

REMEMBER 2: In front-end javascript sometimes it is more useful to forget about classes and construct your
code on simple functions. In that case your code will be more maintainable, debbugable and readable. For the least, remember,
that even the classes are functions in js!
